# Sales-Summarization-Alteryx
This guided project involved the creation of an Alteryx workflow to analyze sales data from a superstore. The primary task was to update the existing sales orders table to include orders spanning from 2016 to 2019, focusing on separate sub-category items and their corresponding sales data. 

Task Highlights:

- Update Sales Orders Table: Expanded the sales orders table to include data from 2016 to 2019, considering separate sub-category items.
- Data Filtering: Applied filters to extract sales data for orders placed within the specified timeframe (January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018).
- Sales Summarization: Calculated the total sales value for each sub-category, aggregating the sales data to provide insights into category-wise performance.
- Export to Excel: Generated a professionally formatted Excel file named "2018 sales data," containing the summarized sales information for further analysis and reporting.

This repository contains the Alteryx workflow, documentation, and resources related to the sales summarization project.
